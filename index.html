			<h2>About my website:</h2>
			<p id="about-website">
			Welcome to my personal website! If I didn't show you the website myself then I'm not sure how you ended up here, but I'm glad you decided to visit.
			This page is both a self-taught learning project, and a record of my work.
			Eventually I would love to have it filled with bits and pieces and odds and ends, but for now it's rather bare.
			To view the source code go take a look at <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/adinfinitum225/super-sea-robin/">the GitHub page</a>.
			</p>
			<h2>About myself:</h2>
			<p id="about-me">
			I'm just an old-school nerd; a fan of math, science, and everything sci-fi. Now I'm trying my hand at the exciting world of web development. 
			Texas State University is my alma mater and I graduated in December of 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics and a minor in Chemistry. 
			Some of my hobbies are practicing the piano, learning to sail, going kayaking, and pretty much anything else that involves the water 
			(if artificial gills existed I'd probably live in the water). 
			I love learning new things, so right now most of my free time is going toward this website and practicing my programming. 
			In summary, I'm just an amateur WebDev looking to go pro, so if you want to make that dream come true feel free to get in contact with me!
